## Detailed Discussion

### Function Parameter Labels

When specifying a function's signature, one must name its parameters. Now by default any call to a function must provide each parameter's label when passing arguments. To not specify these labels is a compile time error.
```
fn function(a: i32, b: f64) {}

function(a: 42, b: 4.2)
```

A function signature may override the outwardly visible parameter label with an equal sign `=`, so the label and the local binding name may be different.
```
fn other_function(a=b: i32) {
  println(f"{a}") // The parameter is still bound to the local symbol `a`
}

// But the label used when passing an argument is `b`
other_function(b: 42)
```

Including the equal sign `=` without providing an overridden label name instead marks that specific parameter to have arguments passed to it *without* the label. Including a label at the callsite for one such parameter is a compile time error.
```
fn yet_another_function(a=: i32) {
  println(f"{a}")
}

yet_another_function(42)
```

### Unions

Fae now includes unions.
```
union Union {
    a: i32
    b: { one: i32, two: i32 }
}
let u: Union = .a(42)
assert(u.b.one == 42)
```

### Overridden Enum Tag Type

Typically when writing an enum the compiler automatically chooses to use a `u8` to represent the tag which differentiates between variants at runtime. 
```
enum Enum {
    A
    B
}

assert(size_of<Enum>() == size_of<u8>()
let instance: Enum = .A
let _: u8 = instance.tag
```

This may now be overridden with an arbitrary integer type.
```
enum Overridden: i32 {
    A
    B
}

assert(size_of<Overridden>() == size_of<i32>()
let instance: Overridden = .A
let _: i32 = instance.tag
```

### Overridden Enum Variant Tag Value

Typically when writing an enum the compiler automatically chooses the value of each variant's tag. This may now be overridden.
```
enum TagValues {
    A = 5
    B = 100
}
```

### Bitflags Enum

Enums may now be specified to be bitflags enums, which enables them to act as type safe bitflag constants.

The most trivial usage automatically picks the bit represntation of each variant.
```
enum(bitflags) SupportedPresentModes {
    Mailbox
    Fifo
    Immediate
}
```

These still mostly operate like normal enums, but with the added ability to perform bitwise manipulation.
```
mut supported: SupportedPresentModes = .Mailbox | .Fifo
```

When applying the `is` operator to a bitflags enum, the operation returns `true` if the specified variant's bit pattern is present. This operation may return `true` for multiple different variants when applied to the same value.
```
let _ = supported is Mailbox // true
let _ = supported is Fifo // true
let _ = supported is Immediate // false
```

A bitflags enum may be initialized with no variants set with a plain `0` (zero) number literal.
```
supported = 0
let _ = supported is Mailbox // false
```

The first variant starts with a bit pattern of `0b1`, with each successive variant using the next most significant bit. Like other enums this value may be manually specified, and any following variant without a specified value will choose the next most significant bit after the most significant bit of the manually specified tag value.
```
enum(bitflags) BitflagsTagValues {
  A // 0b1
  B // 0b10
  C = 0b111
  D // 0b1000
  E // 0b10000
}
```

### Zero Initialized Bindings

Typically when creating a `let` or `mut` binding, one must provide an initialization expression. However when interacting with some C-style APIs which rely on out-pointers, it may be needlessly overwrought to manually initialize a binding just so it can be overwritten via an out pointer. Zero initialized bindings solve this problem by avoiding having to manually initialize the binding while still guaranteeing a well defined value.
```
mut value: SomeComplexType --- // This binding is *fully* zeroed
some_function(value.&mut)
```

### Opaque Structs

A struct may now be marked as opaque, to signify to the compiler that the size and layout of the struct is unknown. This prevents usage of `size_of` on the struct, storing an instance on the stack, passing by value, de


### Statically Sized Arrays

Previously Fae only had a concept of slices; a fat pointer consisting of a pointer to the first item and an item count. Their type signature is written as `[]T` where `T` is the type of the items.

Fae now also supports statically sized arrays, sequences of values where the length is encoded in the type system and the entire contents are logically passed by value. Their type signature is written as `[N]T` where `N` is the length and `T` is the type of the items.

Slice literals are now joined by array literals.
```
// Slice literal
let slice = []i32 { 4, 2 }
let _: []i32 = slice

// Array literal
let array = [_]i32 { 4, 2 }
let _: [2]i32 = array
```

Accessing the fake `.slice` field on arrays reinterprets the array as a slice of its contents.
```
let _: []i32 = array.slice
```
