Done since last demo:
 - Added methods on objects
 - Added static methods on types
 - Added `else if`, `else`, `break`, and `continue`
 - Added automatic pointer dereference for field access and method calls
 - Added `isize`, now the general length/index/size type
 - Added modulo, bitshifts, and bitwise operators
 - Added assignment versions of all binary operations
 - Fixed logical operators not short circuting
 - Fixed slice pointer having wrong mutability
 - Fixed slices having the wrong alignment
 - Fixed some minor ABI issues
 - Fixed several compiler panics

 Remaining features for minimum viable *language*:
  - Private field
  - String formatting
  - Slice slicing and range type
  - Defer
  - Block expressions
  - Unions + sum types and pattern matching
  - Error system
  - Traits
  - Extremely limited operator overloading
  - `for _ in _` iteration
  - Function pointers
  - Allocator system
  - Named parameters and field name match omitting
  - Statically sized array type
  - Functions infer generic parameters from arguments
  - Anonymous structs
  - Per-platform conditional compilation
  - Const structs
  - Multi-line strings
  - Glob imports
