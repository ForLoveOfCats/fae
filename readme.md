# Features implemented:
 - Basic error-tolerant parsing, limited huristics for recovery but it's a start
    - Single line comments
    - Multi-line comments
    - Strings with escape sequences, including \" and \\
 - Most of an error-tolerant type system and checker, much more advanced in its recovery
    - Primative numeric types (i8-i64, u8-u64, f32-f64, usize)
    - Codepoint literals (u32)
    - Structs
    - Pointers (mutable and non-mutable) (not constructable yet)
    - Slices (mutable and non-mutable with access to pointer and len) (not constructable yet)
    - Strings (slices of u8)
    - Variable type inferrence from expression
    - Generics
        - Generic structs
        - Generic functions
        - Functions declared within generic functions inheriting type arguments
 - Compile time const value system
    - Constant folding with compile time known numerics
    - "Typeless" numeric constants, they "just work"
    - Basic constant type inferrence
 - Bindings
    - Mutable variables
    - Immutable bindings
 - Beginnings of block expressions
    - Accepted and handled correctly by the compiler (useless without `give`/`yield` keyword)
 - Module system
    - Module structure derived from file system
    - Imports of individual items
    - Direct path referencing an item (no importing of scopes yet)
 - Extern functions
    - Specify C header to include (deduplicated across the entire project)
    - Define signature and the external symbol name
 - Basic codegen via emitting C
  - De-sugar-s generic specializations into unique items
  - Separates out sub-expressions to allow for block expressions
    - Guarentees evaluation order as a nice bonus


# Short-medium term plans:
 - Control flow
    - Needs to be done correctly to support enum variant flow typing in the future
 - Infer generic arguments from actual function arguments
 - Pointer casts
 - Pointer dereferences
 - Methods
 - Traits (w/generic trait bounds)
 - Visibility modifiers for methods and fields
 - Anonymous structs
 - Enums
    - Independent variant types
    - Flow control based typing
 - Improve parser error handling huristics
 - Parallelize parsing and semantic analysis
    - Planned from the beginning, mostly just type system stuff needs to be done
 - Code formatter
 - Tree-sitter grammer
 - Language server protocol server
